This is a library of supplemental icons, to be used in conjunction with the standard Material Design icons in PX Blue applications.


## Installation
To install the PX Blue icon font from NPM as a dependency for your project, you can run one of the following commands in your project root:
```
npm install --save @pxblue/icons
or
yarn add @pxblue/icons
```
You then need to reference the font in your application so that it is available for use.

#### Angular
In order to use the icon font, you will need to modify your angular.json file "styles" entries (there is one under "build" and one under "test") to include the icon font reference:
```
"styles": [
    "src/styles.scss",
    "./node_modules/typeface-open-sans",
    "./node_modules/@pxblue/icons/iconfont/PXBlueIcons.css"
],
```

#### React
For React, you'll need to require the font in your top-level JS file (typically index.js).
```
require('@pxblue/icons/iconfont/PXBlueIcons.css');
```

## Using the icon font in your application
This will make the PX Blue icons available to your code by using the appropriate class name (className for React) on a ```<i>``` element, e.g.:
  
```
<i class="pxb-ICONNAME"></i>
```

### Applying Different Colors
To change the color of the icon you are using, simply set the CSS color property. This property is inheritable, so if the property is not set on your icon, it will be inherited from the parent container.

```
<i class="pxb-ICONNAME" style="color: red"></i>
```

### Available Icons
See [Available Icons](https://github.com/pxblue/icons/blob/master/available_icons.md) for a list of currently available icons.

* [SVG Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/icons-svg)
* [React Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/icons-mui)
